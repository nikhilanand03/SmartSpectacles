# Digital Microphones

We used the INMP441 digital microphone and collected data from it using the code given in the 'digitalMic-sketch.ino' file. We were able to plot and visualise the
data from the digital microphones and see how each microphone responded to an audio source. This data would later be fed into our Delay Sum Beamforming Algorithm
to figure out the angle from which the sound is coming based on the dimensions of the phased array system of the 4 microphones.
